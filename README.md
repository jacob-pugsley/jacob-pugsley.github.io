<h1>WSUV Cartographers</h1>

<b>Overview</b><br>
The goal of this project is to improve the existing map of the Washington State University Vancouver campus.
The current map only shows building names and does not provide any additional insight into what kind of resources exist inside; as
of now, most of this data is simply unavailable to anyone without physical access to the buildings themselves, such as a prospective student.<br>

The new map adds interactivity to the existing one, so that a user can click on a building or parking lot to learn more about it.<br>

<b>A live version of the project is available <a href="https://jacob-pugsley.github.io/cartographers/index.html">here</a>.</b><br>


This project uses jQuery and Semantic UI in addition to HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
