				<b>Description:</b> An online version of Battleship built with ASP.NET and a SQL database. The project uses the model-view-controller
				pattern to separate the game logic from the data and currently supports a standard game. Future goals include
				implementing user accounts with OAuth2 verification and supporting online multiplayer through a cloud-hosting service<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b>C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, MySQL<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> This is an individual project.<br>
				<b>What I learned:</b> I am building this project to learn C#, ASP.NET, and MVC. Since I am building both the front end and back end components of this application,
				I am also learning more about full-stack development and interacting with a SQL database.

			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> Simple FishBase is a Python-based search engine for searching fish species from <a href="fishbase.org">FishBase</a>, a scientific database of fish species. The original dataset is designed for researchers and as such is a bit too complex for the needs of the average fish tank owner, so the goal of this project was to design a simpler, more accessible interface.<br>
				<b>Related courses:</b> CS 483 - Web Data<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> JavaScript, Python, Vue.js/Node.js, Semantic UI, Whoosh!, Flask, rFishBase (API for FishBase.org)<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> I designed the front end portion using Vue, JavaScript, and Axios for retrieving and displaying search results. The search results were hosted on a separate server which I designed using Flask; I created a system to parse and execute user queries using Whoosh search indexing.<br>
				<b>Other contributors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Patrick Kent - Worked with a third-party R script (rFishBase) that scraped data directly from FishBase and stored it in a CSV file for easy indexing.</li>
					<li>rOpenSci/Carl Boettiger - Developers of rFishBase, a tool for getting data from FishBase.org</li>
				</ul>
				<b>What I learned:</b> The biggest thing I took away from the project was a greater understanding of Vue, which can be a very powerful tool. Before this project, I thought I had an understanding of the framework, but it turns out there was much more to learn. I also learned more about Node and designing web-based projects the way they might be designed in the industry.

			<div class="imageDiv"><img src="images/printersim/devicelist.png"><img src="images/printersim/guitab.png"></div>
			
			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> This project is a device simulator application produced for HP. The simulator allows engineers to test software without having to work on an actual device. The application currently allows for viewing device statistics and for setting properties such as ink level and substrate type, with the potential for more features to be added in the future. This was a year-long project that interfaces with various HP endpoints.<br>
				<b>Related courses:</b> CS 421 - Software Design Project I/II<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Vue.js, Axios, Java/Springboot<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> I was responsible for developing the front end user interface, which was built in JavaScript using Vue.js. I designed and implemented various "widgets" including a nice chart for displaying and a search result component that shows a specific device along with some basic information.<br>
				<b>Other contributors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Julian Keller - Backend and security features</li>
					<li>Adam Pipes - Backend and AWS instance management</li>
					<li>Tyler Higgins - Frontend and interfacing with the backend/HP</li>
					<li>Ri Zhang - Backend database</li>
				</ul>
				<b>What I learned:</b> Over the course of this year-long project I learned to work with a sponsor/client to develop software that met their evolving project requirements. Unlike a regular school project, this project required us to work in the industry with a real client, and I that experience has been invaluable to me. I also gained a stronger knowledge of Vue.js, specifically on using it in conjunction with a web API, which isn't always as straightforward as it may seem.

				<b>Related courses:</b> CS 458 - Mobile Application Development<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> Kotlin, Android<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> This was an individual project.<br>
				<b>What I learned:</b> This project built on my previous experience in game design and served as a crash-course in Android development, including interacting with the hardware sensors. I also developed an understanding of the Kotlin programming language including its advantages over Java.

			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> DungeonCrawl is a multiplayer RPG based on <i>Gauntlet</i> (1985). Both the server and client are written entirely in Java. The random maps were generated by a Python script that randomly generates "rooms and hallways".<br>
				<b>Related courses:</b> CS 447 - Computer Game Design<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> Java, Python, GIMP (for some graphics)<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> I was responsible for developing the item and combat systems. Randomly generated items have unique properties and effects on those who use them and different actions based on the item type.<br>
				<b>Other contributors:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Julian Keller - Graphics, AI, and characters</li>
					<li>Tyler Higgins - Networking</li>
					<li>Dr. Scott Wallace - Designed the underlying game engine used in this project</li>
				</ul>
				<b>What I learned:</b> This project helped me learn better development strategies for working on an intensive project with a small team. After doing it, I feel more ready to approach a career in software development. More technically, I gained a greater understanding of how to write code for systems that run in a constant input/ouput loop as opposed to systems that just run once and produce some result.

					<h2>WSUV Cartographers</h2>

			<div class="ui clearing divider"></div>
			<div class="imageDiv"><img src="images/cartographers/vecs.png"><img src="images/cartographers/search.png"></div>
			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> In this project, my group designed an interactive map of the WSUV campus. The current map is just a flat PDF with building names on it; it does not allow anyone to see what resources are available within the buildings and I don't think it is helpful to new and prospective students. Our map allows users to click or tap on a building on the map to view images and detailed information about the building itself and what kind of services it offers. The map also displays information on parking lots such as their color and permit cost. I had hoped this project would become the official campus map, but ultimately that did not happen.<br>
				<b>Related courses:</b> English 402 - Technical Writing<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> JavaScript, jQuery, Semantic UI<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> I designed all of the software parts of the project including the user interface and backend. Other group members were responsible for gathering all the images and building interfaces.<br>
				<b>Other contributors: </b>
				<ul>
					<li>Jenee Erickson - Images and building information</li>
					<li>Eden Gilmer - Images and building information</li>
					<li>Taylor Bolas - Images and building information</li>
					<li>Designers of the original WSUV map, which was used as a background image for this project</li>
				</ul>
				<b>What I learned:</b> Over the course of this project I learned the basics of web development and Semantic UI. I already had a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but had not really designed a web application yet. I also learned how to use jQuery for the first time, which I think is a good tool to have knowledge of despite it being outdated now. I also gained some knowledge of developing web applications that will work just as well on a smaller screen such as on a mobile device. Of course, I also learned a lot about the buildings and parking lots on my university campus which has been helpful for anyone who asks me about them.

			<p>
				<b>Description:</b> The goal of this project was to develop a small file transfer server as a culmination of everything we had learned about C and Linux. The server had to respond to commands given by the user through a client interface to upload and retrieve files; it was also required to handle multiple clients at one time.<br>
				<b>Related courses:</b> CS 360 - Systems Programming<br>
				<b>Technologies used:</b> C, more specifically client/server protocols<br>
				<b>My involvement:</b> This was an individual project aided by some networking code provided by the instructor.<br>
				<b>What I learned:</b> I learned how to use a low-level programming language to create a system that could potentially be used in real life instead of just another toy project. Through this project and the course as a whole I learned how to write good and robust code in C and to read Linux manual pages to find the information I need on specific functions. I also learned that C networking is one of the most complicated systems to set up and get working short of x86 Assembly, but that it is a good way to put one's C skills to the test.
